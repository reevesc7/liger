# Liger-Testbed

**Required Packages:** `liger`

A directory for testing `sklearn.BaseEstimator` subclasses using `liger`
dataset and training/testing features.

An example script is provided, but everything else is left as an exercise for the user.

## Setting up environment

### 0. Requirements

You will need a working
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download),
[Miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/),
or [Miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge)
installation.

### 1. Create a Conda environment to work in:

```
conda create -n liger python=3.10
```

### 2. Activate Conda environment:

```
conda activate liger
```

### 3. Install requirements:

While in the directory of the desired experiment,

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Copy `example.py`:

The file `config.py` is ignored by git,
allowing users to modify it as needed for experiments.

```
cp example.py load_and_test.py
```

### 5. Modify script as needed:

The example script outllines how to load in a pipeline generated by `tpot`,
load in a dataset with `liger`, and run K-fold validation via `liger` and
more manually.
Modify functionality of any scripts to test whatever models in whatever ways.
Only `/example.py` is tracked by git.
